# 🚀 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Algorithm Visualizer – because watching numbers shuffle around is way more satisfying than it should be. This interactive tool lets you see Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and 7+ more algorithms in action with step-by-step animations, execution time tracking, and speed control. Built with a modern full-stack approach, this app makes sorting fun (well, as fun as sorting can be).

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Spring Boot, Java, Gradle
- API Handling: Axios, REST API
- Deployment: Render (Backend), AWS Amplify (Frontend)
- Containerization: Docker


#⚡ Live Demo

👉 Frontend: https://sorting-visualizer.yourdomain.com
👉 Backend API: https://sorting-algorithm-visualizer-xhpi.onrender.com
📢 Heads Up!

- The backend URL does not have a landing page, so opening it in your browser might just show an error. Don't worry – the API calls work fine!
- Since the backend is hosted on Render, it sometimes takes a nap when not in use. If there's no response at first, give it a minute or two – it's just waking up. (Hey, we all need our beauty sleep. ☕)

# 🎮 How to Use
1) Pick an Algorithm from the dropdown (Bubble Sort? Quick Sort? You decide).
2) Watch the bars animate as the algorithm does its thing.
3) Control the speed with the slider (Turbo Mode? Slow-mo? Your call).
4) Step through manually or hit "Play Until End" to let it run.
5) Want a new challenge? Pick a different algorithm – the bars will reset instantly.


# 🚀 Deployment
**Backend (Render)**
- Dockerized and deployed on Render (cold starts might make it slow for the first request).
- API Base URL: https://sorting-algorithm-visualizer-xhpi.onrender.com
  
**Frontend (AWS Amplify)**
- Hosted on AWS Amplify with continuous deployment from GitHub.

# 🐛 Troubleshooting
- Backend not responding? It’s probably in hibernation mode. Just wait 1-2 minutes and refresh.
- Frontend loads but doesn't fetch data? Check the console logs (F12 in browser). If it's a CORS issue, make sure the backend is running and responding.
- "Cannot GET /bubble-sort" error? You might have an extra or missing slash in your API calls. Double-check your Axios requests.
